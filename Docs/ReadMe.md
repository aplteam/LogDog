# LogDog: Log File Viewer

![LogDog's icon](http://misc.aplteam.com/LogDog.ico){width="32" height="32" style="margin-right:15px;"}
LogDog is designed to display up to 5000 lines (configurable) of a log file, and to constantly update it.

LogDog comes with a stand-alone EXE. There are no requirements if you want to run this.

In order to load the workspace you need at least version 15.0 of Dyalog APL installed in your machine.

Notes:

* There is no installation routine.

  However, you should copy LogDog to a place where it has write access.
* You can start the Help by double-clicking ViewHelp.exe in the `Help\` sub folder.
