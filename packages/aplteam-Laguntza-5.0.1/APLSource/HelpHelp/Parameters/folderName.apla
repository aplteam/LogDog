 ''
 '# folderName'
 ''
 '`folderName` defines the folder that hosts...'
 ''
 '* the file created by the compile process '
 '* any assets like CSS files, JavaScript files, images and documents like PDF files etc.'
 ''
 'If `foldername` is not set a temporary folder is created and used. However, normally you '
 'will set this parameter to avoid the overhead of compiling the help file over and over again'
 'and to allow access to assets like images that are referenced in the help system with '
 'relative paths.'
 ''
 'Compiling once also means that you don''t need the `MarkAPL` class anymore in order to put'
 'the help system on display.'
 ''
 'If `folderName` is set and exists then Laguntza will create the compiled file in it.'
 'It will also create a sub-folder and populate it with two CSS files for screen and print.'
 'Anything else in the folder will remain untouched.'
 ''
 'If `folderName` is set and does not exist then Laguntza will create it.'
 ''
 'Note that after compilation you can still move the contents of `foldername` somewhere else'
 'and it will still work except when you''ve specified a directory relative to the current'
 'one. In that case Laguntza would not be able to find images any more, so you should'
 'avoid specifying a relative path.'
