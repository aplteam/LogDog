 r←A
⍝ Returns a ref pointing to APLTreeUtils.
⍝ Used only in case a function in ⎕THIS is called
⍝ that is NOT one of the Run* functions: they all establish
⍝ a reference "A" which is localized in that Run*-function.
⍝ When ∆Ref is visible from this function then it uses
⍝ ∆Ref.A; that will be much faster than searching for
⍝ APLTreeUtils whenever `A` is referred to.
 :If 9=⎕NC'∆Ref'
     r←∆Ref.A
 :Else
     r←APLTreeUtils2
 :EndIf
