 {r}←∆Ref ShowTopic id;bool
⍝ [0] Makes the form visible.\\
⍝ [1] Converts "id" into a row number pointing into `∆Ref.d.tree`. "id" can be one of:\\
⍝ * A simple name. However, if this identifies more than on page only the first one is displayed.
⍝ * A full path like `#.MyDoc.Ref.AllFns.MyFns`.
⍝ * An integer. This is treated then as a `TopicID`. This is the recommended way.
⍝   (See method `FindTopic` for an easy way to find a `TopicID`).

⍝
⍝ [2] Makes sure that this row is displayed.\\
⍝ Returns a 0 in case "id" could not be identified ("Page not found" is displayed then)
⍝ or a 1 in case it could.
