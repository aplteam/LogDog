# Tables

|:-||:-:|
| Left| Center |

| C   | D      |

## Overview

Note that table rows are defined by having at least one un-escaped pipe symbol. You may however add a leading 
as well as a trailing pipe symbol if you wish so. Many consider this to be more readable.

Note that leading and trailing spaces are removed from every cell.

## Constructing tables

The very simple table definition with just one column:

~~~
Name|
-|
APL|
Cobol|
PHP|
~~~

resulting in this:

Name|
-|
APL|
Cobol|
PHP|

With two columns:

~~~
| Name  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| APL   | Great   |
| Cobol | Old     |
| PHP   | Oh dear |
~~~

This results in this:

| Name  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| APL   | Great   |
| Cobol | Old     |
| PHP   | Oh dear |

## Without column headers

Without the `|-----|--------|` part the table has no column headers at all:

~~~
| APL  | Great |
| Cobol| Old   |
| PHP| Oh dear |
~~~

| APL  | Great |
| Cobol| Old   |
| PHP| Oh dear |

## Column alignment

Note the colons in row two of the following example: they define the alignment of all cells in that column.

~~~
|Name | Meaning| Numbers |
|:-   |:------:|--------:|
| 1.00   | 1      |  1.00 |
| -99.12   | -9999.12      | -99.12 | 
~~~

This results in:

|L    | C      | R       |
|:-   |:------:|--------:|
| 1.00   | 1      |  1.00 |
| -99.12   | -9999.12      | -99.12 |  

If you want a table without column titles but alignment:

~~~
|:-|:-:|-:|
| Left| Center |   Right |
| A   | B      |  1.00 |
| C   | D      | -99.12 |     
~~~

|:-|:-:|-:|
| Left| Center |   Right |
| A   | B      |  1.00 |
| C   | D      | -99.12 | 


## Inline mark-up within cells

Cells can use in-line mark-up. The following table shows examples for **bold**, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~,
external links, code and line breaks within cells. Internal links are possible as well of course.

~~~
|First name          |Last Name |No.        |Code             |
|:-------------------|:---------|-----:|:--------------------:|
|Kai                 |Jaeger    |1     |`{{⍵/⍨2=+⌿0=⍵∘.|⍵}⍳⍵}`|
|Johann-Wolfgang     |von Goethe|1923  |`{(⍴,⍵)÷+/,⍵}`        |
|<http://aplwiki.com>|**bold**  |123.23|`fns ⍣a=b⊣123`        |
|_Italic_            |~~Strike~~|      |\|                    |
|line<<br>>break     |          |      |                      |
|Last line           |          |      |                      |
~~~

|First name          |Last Name |No.        |Code             |
|:-------------------|:---------|-----:|:--------------------:|
|Kai                 |Jaeger    |1     |`{{⍵/⍨2=+⌿0=⍵∘.|⍵}⍳⍵}`|
|Johann-Wolfgang     |von Goethe|1923  |`{(⍴,⍵)÷+/,⍵}`        |
|<http://aplwiki.com>|**bold**  |123.23|`fns ⍣a=b⊣123`        |
|_Italic_            |~~Strike~~|      |\|                    |
|line<<br>>break     |          |      |                      |
|Last line           |          |      |                      |

## Escaping characters

Note that in the previous table one cell contains a pipe symbol (`|`); normally that would confuse the parser but
not in this case because it is escaped with a backslash character: `\|`.

## Special attributes

Note that you can assign →[*.Special_attributes] to a table; see there for details.
