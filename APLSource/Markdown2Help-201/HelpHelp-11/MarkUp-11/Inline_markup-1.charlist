# Inline mark-up

## Bold

You can make a word appear in bold by putting it between either a pair of `**` or a pair if `__`:
                 
~~~
This is **bold**!
~~~

leads to this:

This is **bold**!


## Italic
                  
You can make a word appear in italic by putting it between two `*` or two `_`:
                 
~~~
This is _italic_!
~~~

leads to this:

This is _italic_! 

Note however that an underscore character within a word does not have any effect: This_remains_unaffected.

## Bold and italic

~~~
This **_is bold and italic_**!
~~~

Leads to this:

This **_is bold and italic_**!

## Strikethrough

~~~
This ~~is strikethrough~~!
~~~

This leads to:

This ~~is strikethrough~~!

## Escaping

In some instances you must escape a character. A common application is when you want to mention a variable with a 
name that starts with an underscore character without it making the rest of the help page Italic.

\_varsName
~~~       

Leads to this:

\_varsName
