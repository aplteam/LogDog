[DATA]:index='CSS folder'

# The "CSS" folder

This folder holds the "print.css" and the "screen.css" files which determine the outlook of the
help topics on screen and when printed.

By default `Markdown2Help` populates these files with default CSS. You can change this by specifying
a CSS file via the `→[*.cssPrintFilename]` and/or `→[*.cssScreenFilename]`.

The files you specify will then be copied to this folder at compile time.
