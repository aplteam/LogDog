→[#.Markdown2Help.HelpHelp.Methods.CreateParms]

Naturally these links can become lengthy. They have an advantage however: such a link
cannot be ambiguous.

However, you can also use →[*.Relative_Links|relative links] but cut off just the parent namespace

~~~
→[*.HelpHelp.Methods.CreateParms]
~~~

That would almost certainly result in a distinct link.
