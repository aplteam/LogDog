# Compiled File

## Development mode

For the sake of performance any help project is pre-processed and the result is then saved in a
single file. That improves performance dramatically for all search operations, for example.

By default the help file is saved into a folder within the Windows `Temp\` directory. You can
change this by specifying `folderName` in the parameter space passed to the `→[*.New]` method.

## Runtime mode

Depending on the application you might want to offer the user the opportunity to start a help
system with a double-click in Windows Explorer rather than from within your application.

How this can be achieved is explained on the →[*.Standalone_Application] help topic.

## Internal structure of the file

The first 10 components are reserved. This is what these components are used for:

1. Tree; the data structure that is driving the GUI.
2. Words; a vector of text vectors with as many items as there are help pages/nodes. Every item
   contains a list with words extracted from the corresponding help page. An item might be empty.
3. Same as [2] but all words are lowercased.
4. Index; this is a three-item vector with these pieces if information:
   1. Entries as shown in the index.
   1. Corresponding row number referring to the tree.
   1. Matrix with information useful for searching and display purposes.

The remaining components (5 to 10) are reserved.

The help pages start with component 11. Therefore a help file has as many components as there are
help pages and nodes plus 10.
