# TopicProperties

## Overview

Normally all children of a given node, namespaces and variables alike, are listed
alphabetically with the namespaces first.

This may or may not be appropriate. Therefore there must be a way to define a different sequence.

Also, the names of namespaces are used for the captions in the tree  view (after replacing any
underscore characters by a space). Again this might not be appropriate; for example, you cannot
have a node or page named "Cameron's disasters".

Both problems can be addressed by introducing a function `∆TopicProperties` into  a node. As a
bonus you can define that a certain item is inactive (won't make an appearance) or is on display
only when not running with `→[*.userMode|userMode=0]`.

Such a function can easily be introduced via the tree view's context menu: select "Manage
∆TopicProperties" and you are done. This will introduce a skeleton of such a function which
comprises all the children (nodes and pages) of that node.

Note that when you inject, delete or rename help topics or nodes from `Markdown2Help`'s context menu
then a `∆TopicProperties` function that is affected by the operation will be changed automatically
by `Markdown2Help` for you.

## Example

Here is an example of what such a function looks like (without the comments):

~~~
∆TopicProperties←{
r←0 4⍴''
r⍪←'Simple_Links' '' 1 0
r⍪←'Complex_Links' '' 1 0
r⍪←'Camerons_Desasters' 'Cameron's_Desasters' 0 0
r
}
~~~

The columns:

1. The node or variable name.
1. The caption for the tree view; if this is empty, the name of the variable is taken but any 
   underscore characters are replaced by blanks.
1. Boolean that defines whether this node/topic is active.
1. Boolean that defines whether this node/topic will show up in developer's mode only.


## Misc

### Changing ∆TopicProperties

You **must not** make any other changes than those affecting the result because under certain
circumstances any `∆TopicProperties` function will be recreated under program control from its
explicit result, meaning that your changes would vanish.

### Locating the right ∆TopicProperties function

When you click on a node and select the "Manage ∆TopicProperties" command you will end up editing
the function `∆TopicProperties` of the **parent node**.

If you think you might have trouble remembering this then think of any other way to introduce/edit
a `∆TopicProperties` function at the top level - there is none!

### Be aware: changes

Any changes to a Help system performed from its context menu will be handled automatically by
`Markdown2Help` for you by changing the appropriate `∆TopicProperties` function when this is necessary.

If you perform those steps by other means then it is **your responsibility** to keep
`∆TopicProperties` up to date.

### Be aware: ignored help topics

In the Developer's menu there is a command "Report\TopicProperties" which checks **all**
`∆TopicProperties` and reports its findings to the session. Any variable representing a help
topic that exists but is not mentioned by its `∆TopicProperties` won't show so this is important thing 
to check.
