# Bookmarks

The user may add bookmarks in order to find certain pages faster. Therefore the user will expect
those bookmarks to survive between sessions.

In order to achieve that you **must not** set `→[*.regPath]` to 0 (see there for details) because
that disables the "save individual settings in the Windows Registry". 

In case `→[*.helpCaption]` is empty you must actually set `→[*.regPath]`; see there for details.
