[DATA]:index='saltFolder ⋄ SALT ⋄ Storing your help system'

# saltFolder

In case you want your help system to be managed by SALT you must specify this.

If the help system lives in, say, `#.Container.MyHelp` then `saltFolder` could be something like `D:\HelpSystems\`.
The help system would then be saved in `D:\HelpSystems\MyHelp` which will be created by Markdown2Help for you.
