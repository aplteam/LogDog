[DATA]:index='userMode'

# userMode

This defaults to the type of Dyalog EXE it is running under: Development or Runtime.

You can set this to 1 to force `Markdown2Help` to run in userMode.

With `userMode←1` there will be no "Development" menu in the menu bar, and most commands 
of the context menus will disappear as well.
