[DATA]:index='helpVersionDate ⋄ Version date'

# helpVersionDate

By default this becomes the version date of `Markdown2Help` itself.

You might want to replace this by your own piece of information.

If you don't want this information (together with `→[*.helpVersion]`) to make an appearance at all
then simply set both parameters to `''`.
