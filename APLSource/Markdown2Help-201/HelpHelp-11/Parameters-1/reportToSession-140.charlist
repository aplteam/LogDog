[DATA]:index='reportToSession ⋄ Session, report to ⋄ Suppress printing to session'

# reportToSession

Boolean that defaults to `→[*.isRuntime]`.

Potentially there are several things that Markden2Help would report to the session;
broken or ambiguous links are examples.
You can prevent this by settings this to 0.

Note that acre-related messages are **not** affected by this parameter: they will always be printed
to the session.
