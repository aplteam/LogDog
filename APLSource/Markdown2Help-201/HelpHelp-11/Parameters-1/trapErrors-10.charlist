[DATA]:index='trapErrors'

# trapErrors

Boolean that defines whether errors shall be trapped or not.

After calling `CreateParms` this is `¯1`. In that case it will be set later to the value of
`→[*.userMode]`. 

However, you can set this to 1 in order to force `Markdown2Help` to trap errors.

The default makes sure that in runtime Markdown2Help does not break.
