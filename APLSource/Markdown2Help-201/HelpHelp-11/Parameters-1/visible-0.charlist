[DATA]:index='visible ⋄ Hide GUI'

# visible

This is a Boolean that defaults to 1, meaning that by default `Markdown2Help`'s GUI will become
visible when the `→[*.New]` method is called.

However, you might want to start the help system when your application initializes, but to keep the
GUI invisible until the user actually requests a help page. That's when you will set this to 0.

Note that you **must not** set this parameter when the GUI is already up and running. Use the
`→[*.SetVisible]` method instead.
