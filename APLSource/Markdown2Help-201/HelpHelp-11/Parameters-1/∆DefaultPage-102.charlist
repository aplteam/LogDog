# Parameters

The general idea is to create a namespace, populate it with a number of variables with certain
values and pass this to the `→[*.New]` method.

The parameters are **not** designed to be (re-)set when the help system is up  and running. When
changing a parameter at runtime makes sense and is supported then a dedicated method is available;
`→[*.SetNoClose]` is an example.

Note that in order to get going you need to specify either `→[*.folderName]` or `→[*.source]` or 
both depending on the scenario:

* Just `source` in case you want the help file freshly compiled and then put it on display.
* `source` and `folderName` if you want to create a freshly compiled help file for later use.
* Just `folderName` in case you want to reuse an already compiled help file.

There is one other parameter which is set more often than not: `→[*.helpCaption]`.
