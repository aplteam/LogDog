[DATA]:index='noClose ⋄ Close'

# noClose

This is a Boolean that defaults to 0.

Normally when `Markdown2Help`'s close box is clicked or the "Exit help" command from the "File" menu
is selected or Ctrl+W or Alt+F4 is pressed `Markdown2Help` closes down.

For performance reasons you might want it to  become invisible instead: restarting it costs almost
no time then. This can be achieved by setting `noClose` to 1.

Note that you **must not** set this parameter when the GUI is already up and running. Use the
`→[*.SetNoClose]` method instead.
