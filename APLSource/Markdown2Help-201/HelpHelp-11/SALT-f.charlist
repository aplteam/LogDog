# SALT

You may save a help project in text files by setting the parameter `saltFolder` to an empty or non-existent folder.
That folder will then be created and populated with the help project in case that SALT is active (=associated with
the "Fix" event of the editor.

When you add a new help page or a new node then Markdown2Help will make sure that this is saved in a .dyalog file.
When you delete a help page the asscoiated file will be deleted. When you delete a node all pages in this node will
be deleted.

When you edit a help page or a TopicProperty function then the APL editor will ask you whether you want to update
the associated file or not.

If at any point you want SALT to **not** manage your help system (typically for experimentes etc) then you can 
un-check "SALT managed" in the "Developers" menu. This option is of course available only when you are working in
a development environment.
