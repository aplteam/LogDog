# Methods

Here all the public methods are discussed.

Note that in OO speak `Markdown2Help` has just shared methods, no instance methods. Most methods
however actually work on a particular instance; therefore a ref pointing to that instance must be
passed as an argument.

To get a list with all public methods execute this:

~~~
      ⎕←#.Markdown2Help.MethodList
   AllowedTags
 * CloseHelp
 # CompileHelpFiles
 * CompileHelpFilesInto
   CreateParms
 * GetNoClose
 * GetVisible
 * FindTopic
   Inject∆TopicProperties
   ListHelpForms
   New
   Reset
 * SetNoClose
 * SetVisible
 * ShowTopic
~~~

Note that those marked with a `*` need a reference pointing to an instance of Markdown2Help;
that is what is returned by `→[*.New]`. Those marked with `#` also accept such a reference, but
they may also be called with a different argument.
