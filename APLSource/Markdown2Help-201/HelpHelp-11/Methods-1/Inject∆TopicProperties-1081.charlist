# r←\{recursive\} Inject∆TopicProperties ref

Creates a `∆TopicProperties` function in `ref` or, depending on the left argument being 1 rather
than 0 (that is the default), in `ref` and all its sub namespaces.

Note that ref **must not** point to an instance of `Markdown2Help` but a namespace that is a valid
source for such an instance.
