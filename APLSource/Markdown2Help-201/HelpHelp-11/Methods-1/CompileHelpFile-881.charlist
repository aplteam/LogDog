The right argument can be either a parameter space or a ref pointing to an instance of `Markdown2Help`.

`Markdown2Help` compiles the help automatically if it cannot find the files it needs to display the
Help system. Compilation can also be enforced by specifying a `1` as left argument to the
`→[*New]` method. Finally the user can execute the "Compile Help" command from the "Developers"
menu if `→[*.userMode|userMode←0]`.

However, there might still be the need to compile the help file under program control without an
instance of `Markdown2Help`. That's what this method is designed to do.

See →[*.Compiled_File] for details.
