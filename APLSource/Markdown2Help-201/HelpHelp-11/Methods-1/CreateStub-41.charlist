# {ref} ← {parms} CreateStub name

This functions allows you to create a new help system as a starting point. It comes with two pages 
("Overview" and "Copyright") and a sub folder "Sub" that has another two pages, "Foo" and "Goo".

`name` must be the name of the new help system. If it is a relative path (like `Foo`) the help system
is created where the fns was called from. If it is a full path (like `#.Here.Foo`) a help system `Foo`
will be created in the namespace `#.Here` which must already exist.

You can specify a parameter space, typically created by calling `Markdown2Help.CreateParms ''`, as
optional left argument.

`ref` is a reference pointing to the newly created help system.

In case something is wrong with the argument(s) `CreateStub` throws an error.

If you want the new help system to be managed by SALT then →[*.SALT_and_Markdown2Help | look up the details] first.
