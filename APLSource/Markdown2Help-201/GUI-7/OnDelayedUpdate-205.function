⍝ Creates a timer which after its getting fired sends an "Update"
⍝ event round. When the user scrolls through the tree with the
⍝ cursor keys, this is supposed to be so fast that the timer
⍝ is re-created before the event is actually triggered, preventing
⍝ the update to take place before the user releases the key.
