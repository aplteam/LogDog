# Freeze

Sometimes auto-scrolling is not desirable. See â†’[Find] as an example. In such cases you can prevent LogDog
from updating the GUI -- and therefore also autoscrolling -- by ticking the "Freeze" checkbox. The status
bar shows "Frozen" in red then.

Note that the size of the log file is still updated. In case the size of the log file changes while "Freeze"
is ticked the background color of the first status bar field -- that shows the size of the log file -- becomes red.

Note that the "Find" command ticks "Freeze" automatically. This is because "Find" does not make sense with it 
being active.
