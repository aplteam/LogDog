# Memory
 
LogDog grabs 64MB of memory. That should be sufficient to put at least the last 10,000 records on display.

You can change this; see â†’[*Command_line_options] for details.

LogDog reads the records from the end of the file; therefore it will always succeed no matter how big the log 
file is, and the size of the logfile has no impact on how fast LogDog puts a log file on display.

If you increase the default (5000) on a large log file then LogDog's performance might be affected.
