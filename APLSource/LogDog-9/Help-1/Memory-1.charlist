# Memory
 
LogDog.exe grabs 64MB of memory. That should be sufficient to put at least the last 10,000 records on display.                                                                                                     

LogDog reads the records from the end of the file; therefore it will always succeed no matter how big the log 
file is, and the size of the logfile has no impact on how fest LogDog puts a log file on display.
