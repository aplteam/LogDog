# Folders

When you specify a folder then LogDog will investigate that folder. Depending on the outcome
different things will happen:

* If the folder contains files with the extension `.log` then the youngest one will be opened.
* If the folder does not contain any files with the extension `.log` then a Timer will be created. 
  The folder will then be constantly watched.
