# EXE

With the stand-alone EXE (LogDog.exe) you have these options:

* Drag and drop a file or a folder onto the EXE.
* Double-click the EXE and then drag and drop a file or a folder onto the GUI.
* Double-click the EXE and then use the "Open file" menu command.
* Double-click the EXE and then use the "Investigate a folder..." menu command.
* Create a shortcut to LogDoc.exe and add the name of the log file (or the
folder) the "Target" field in the "Properties" dialog of that shortcut. 

 Note that the EXE consumes up to 64MB of memory by default. You can change this 
 by creating a shortcut or a BAT file and then specify "MAXWS" in the "Target" 
 field of the "Properties" dialog with an appropriate value. Examples:

* `MAXWS=1024 ‚çù` Interpreted as kilobytes
* `MAXWS=10MB`
* `MAXWS=1GB`
