# Installation
 
There is no installation. Just copy what you've downloaded from the APL wiki into any folder
and that's it really. See â†’[Usage] for details.

Note that LogDog writes crash data into `%LOCALAPPDATA\LogDog` where it should have the right 
to create and write files. It does not matter whether LogDog has the right to write to its
own folder.
