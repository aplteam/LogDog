# CommandLine

You can specify the name of the file to be watched via the command line. You can also specify the
`NoOfRecords` parameter which has a default value of 5000.

Example:

~~~
C:\dyalog.exe -noOfRecords=5000 -file=MyLogFile C:\LogDog.dws
~~~

Or:

~~~
C:\LogDog.exe C:\LogDog.dws -noOfRecords=5000 -file=MyLogFile
~~~

Note that you can specify a directory
rather than a file. In that case LogDog will view the youngest file with the extension "log" it
can find within that directory.
