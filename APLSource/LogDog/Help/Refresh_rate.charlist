# Refresh rate

By default the refresh rate is 500 milli seconds. On a machine that is slow (or very busy) you might 
find that this inappropriate. Change it to 1000 (one second) or something close to that.

Going lower than 50 milli seconds however does not make any sense even on a very fast machine.
